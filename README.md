## ***Strictly conforms to Win32 naming conventions.***
## ***Does not aim to be portable at all.***
## ***Note that Win32 redefines `NULL` as 0 in contrast to C's `(void* (0))`.***
## ***Win32 documentation @ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ is reproduced in many places for clarity.***
